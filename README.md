# python-tuto

To run a module of each folder, lets say strings, cd strings > python _runner.py
DONOT make any changes to other files apart from _runner.py, unless you wanna play around in your local machine.
USE ONLY _runner.py file to test the functions.

To get the project on your local,
copy the project url,
find a dir on your machine,
```
   $ git clone <project_url>
   Mostly project_url is https://github.com/akash-potdar7/python-tuto.git
```
wait for it!,
to test find _runner.py in each package(folder),

Want to add something to the existing modules? Or even wanna create modules and contribute?
please do this
  ```
  $ git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -m <"commit msg">
  $ git push origin <your_branch_name>
  ```
NEXT:: IMP:: submit a pull request from github.com, look for the project repo

IMP NOTE: Do not directly push into master
